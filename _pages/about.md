I’m a PhD candidate at the Max Planck Institute for 
[Human Cognitive and Brain Science](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en) under the supervision of
Prof. Marc Schönwiesner and a visiting researcher 
at the [Computational Auditory Perception Group](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html)
 led by Dr. Nori Jacoby.
My interests are about the cross-cultural diversity in music and the methods
we can apply to quantify its characteristics. 
I combine datasets of music around the world with large-scale
behavioural experiments to tackle questions about inter-individual
and cross-cultural differences in music cognition.

Recently, a contemporary composer, a neuroscientist and I have founded the [aiar collective](https://aiar-git.github.io/), with the 
aim to use live brain signals of performers in the context of creative music production.
