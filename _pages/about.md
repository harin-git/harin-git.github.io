I’m a PhD candidate at the Max Planck Institute for 
[Human Cognitive and Brain Science](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en) under the supervision of
Prof. Marc Schönwiesner and a visiting researcher 
at the [Computational Auditory Perception Group](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html)
led by Dr. Nori Jacoby. My interests are about the cross-cultural diversity in music and the methods
we can apply to quantify its characteristics. 
I combine datasets of music around the world with large-scale
behavioural experiments to tackle questions about inter-individual
and cross-cultural differences in music cognition.
<br><br>
Currently I'm interning as a research scientist at [Deezer Research](https://research.deezer.com/) where I explore 
the regional differences in musical diversity and spread of musical trends, 
drawing perspectives on both population and within-user level.
<br><br>
I'm also part of an art collective called [aiar collective](https://aiarcollective.com/). Our aim is to 
use live brain signals of performers in the context of creative music production. 
You can checkout on-going and past projects [here](https://aiarcollective.com/#projects).
<br><br>
In my past life and now occasionally when I have free time (unfortunately not much as a PhD student), 
I make music ([Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/en/album/437597977), 
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2BUL6IneY4Tx9gpRvNwOYM), 
[Apple](https://music.apple.com/us/album/youth/1683998057)),
[Youtube](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ln2QAQ-XArGbe4ZiYborPVjY_S7yAsh_U)).
