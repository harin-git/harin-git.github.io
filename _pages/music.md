## [Timbre Perception Test (TPT) included in Long-Gold Project](https://longgold.org/)
The LongGold project is a longitudinal research study investigating the development of musical abilities across the teenage years. 
The project aims to understand what role music plays in the development of secondary school students. 
It documents how musical skills are related to cognitive abilities, attitudes, personality, psycho-social skills, and academic performance. 
The [Timbre Perception Test (TPT)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-020-02058-3) is now included as one of
the test in the test battery of LongGold for measuring individual's ability to discriminate between timbre.
You can try the demo version of the TPT online [here](https://shiny.gold-msi.org/longgold_demo/?test=TPT).

## [Paper published in ISMIR 2021](https://zenodo.org/record/5625680#.Yczt3BNKjys)
We tested whether Americans, Brazilians and South Koreans perceive the same or
different moods in the music that is local or foreign to them. We then compared
these ratings with current state-of-the-art machine estimates to examine whether
the automatica mood detection algorithms are systematically biased to the US 
(given most training data are English songs).

## [Talk at ICMPC-ESCOM 2021](https://icmpc2021.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/)
I presented about the formation of a new database called _globalPOP_, 
which I extensively gathered representative pop music samples around the world along
with various metadata, machine retrieved features, and lyrics.
Some preliminary results are also discussed.

## [Talk at CIM19](https://sites.google.com/view/cim19/home)
I introduced the Timbre Perception Test (TPT), a new psychoacoustic test for measuring
individual differences in the ability to hear fine-grained variations along
three dimensions of timbre space. For more details watch the [recorded talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8m_uocI_gY),
read the [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-020-02058-3),
or [try out the test](https://osf.io/9c8qz/wiki/home/) yourself.

**update**: there is now an R package, [tptT](https://github.com/harin-git/tptR) 
which is built using the [psychTestR](https://github.com/pmcharrison/psychTestR)
and runs locally using R.
